# Network Traffic Analysis & Security Assessment
**Tools:** `Wireshark` | `Npcap` | `Windows Event Viewer`

### Objective
To monitor, capture, and analyze live network traffic to evaluate protocol security and observe how various data layers interact during active sessions.

### Key Skills
* **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI):** Analyzing packet headers and payloads.
* **Protocol Analysis:** Detailed examination of TCP/IP, DNS, and ARP behaviors.
* **Security Hardening:** Identifying plaintext vulnerabilities and recommending encryption standards.
* **Incident Detection:** Recognizing patterns associated with network reconnaissance.

### Project Summary
In this project, I conducted a **4.5-hour live traffic capture** to establish a network security baseline. By isolating critical protocol behaviors, I analyzed the mechanics of the **TCP three-way handshake** and **ARP device discovery**.
