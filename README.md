# Projects
This is a compilation of my cybersecurity related projects, some done for classes, some done for self study

### **Network Analysis Report**: 
This project involved a deep-dive analysis of live network traffic to establish a security baseline and identify protocol vulnerabilities. Using Wireshark and Npcap, I captured and analyzed over 1.3 million packets over a 4.5-hour session. The analysis focused on the mechanics of the TCP three-way handshake and the critical security differences between plaintext (HTTP/ARP) and encrypted (HTTPS/TLS) communications. This work demonstrates proficiency in packet-level forensics and a strong understanding of how unencrypted data exposure impacts network security.

### **Password Cracking Project**: 
In this project, I performed a hands-on assessment of authentication security by simulating various password-cracking attacks against Linux and Windows systems. Utilizing Johnny (John the Ripper) and Ophcrack, I demonstrated how standard hashing algorithms—specifically those securing the /etc/shadow and SAM files—can be compromised in minutes using dictionary attacks and rainbow tables
