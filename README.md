# Projects
This is a compilation of my cybersecurity related projects, some done for classes, some done for self study

**Network Sniffing**: Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark Objective: To monitor, capture, and analyze network traffic to evaluate protocol security and understand how various data layers interact during live sessions.
    **Tools:** Wireshark, Npcap, Windows Event Viewer.
    **Key Skills:** Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), Protocol Analysis (TCP/IP, DNS, ARP), Security Hardening, and Incident Detection.
    **Summary:** In this project, I performed a 4.5-hour capture of live network traffic to establish a security baseline. I successfully isolated and analyzed critical protocol behaviors, including the TCP three-way            handshake and ARP device discovery. A major focus was the comparative analysis of HTTP vs. HTTPS, illustrating the risk of plaintext data exposure and the necessity of TLS encryption for sensitive communications.
